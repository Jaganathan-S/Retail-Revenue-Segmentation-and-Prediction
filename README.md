# 📊 Retail Revenue Segmentation & Prediction

## 📍 Project Overview

The **Retail Revenue Segmentation & Prediction** project focuses on analyzing retail sales data to segment customers based on purchasing behavior and predict future **total revenue**. This project leverages a combination of advanced data science techniques such as **KMeans Clustering**, **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**, and sophisticated **Machine Learning models** (XGBoost and LightGBM) to provide actionable insights for improved business decision-making.

This project serves as a valuable resource for professionals looking to:

* Segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior.
* Predict future total revenue using customer metrics.

## 🔑 Key Features

* Customer Segmentation using KMeans**: Uncover hidden patterns in customer behavior and categorize them into meaningful clusters.
* **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA**: Visualize high-dimensional data in a 2D space to identify key relationships within the data.
* **Revenue Prediction using XGBoost & LightGBM**: Build predictive models to forecast future revenue, enhancing strategic decision-making.

## 📈 Workflow & Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing**:

   * Import and clean the dataset, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting date columns.
   * Conduct feature engineering, which includes the creation of key metrics such as **Average Purchase Value** to enhance predictive capabilities.

2. Clustering with KMeans**:

   * Standardize the data to ensure that all features are on the same scale.
   * Apply **KMeans clustering** to segment customers into distinct groups based on their total revenue and purchase frequency.

3. PCA for Visualization**:

   * Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data, enabling clearer visual representation and understanding of customer segments.

4. Machine Learning Models**:

   * Train and evaluate two machine learning models, **XGBoost** and **LightGBM**, to predict total revenue based on customer features.
   * Evaluate the model performance using metrics such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score** to assess predictive accuracy.

5. Results:

   * Present visualizations of clustering outcomes and model performance to provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between customer behavior and predicted revenue.
